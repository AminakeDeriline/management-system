 With a recommendation letter from my school, 
I was able to do my internship in ENEO Cameroon as a second-year student in Software Engineering. 
This internship is a way for interns to gain practical experience in the field. Eneo Cameroon is a company that deals with the production and distribution of energy. It accepts interns in order to build their skills and these interns can end up being employed by the company at the end of their studies. I was given a theme, which was “AUDIT RECOMMENDATION FINDINGS”. This internship helped me integrate into the professional world while putting into practice my knowledge gained from school and learning new ones.
